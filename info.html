            <b>Q: When is the project coming out?</b><br>
            A: When it's ready.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: What platforms will this be on?</b><br>
            A: We're currently only targeting the PC (Steam/EA) platform. We currently cannot support consoles (Xbox One/Xbox Series/PS4/PS5) due to technical limitations.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: Will this cost money to use?</b><br>
            A: No. We couldn't charge you money even if we wanted to due to legal reasons.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: What features of Social Play will be supported?</b><br>
            A: We plan to eventually support everything (excl. Companion App). However, some features may be missing on the initial launch. You will be able to find out more in our Discord.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: Is this project backed/supported by EA or DICE?</b><br>
            A: No. This project is 100% a community effort. We are not associated with EA or DICE in any way.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: Will the project be open-sourced?</b><br>
            A: We're sceptical of open sourcing the project due to legal reasons but it's something we may be open to in the future.
